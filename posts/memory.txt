### The Forgotten
Ever have that feeling where it's as if you forgot something? Do you also ever get that feeling where your disk space is full for some reason? 
Okay no we're not talking about computers' memory but instead, we're going to talk about yours. Your memory. I'm no expert I don't do any brain analysis or whatever the hell scientists know or do these days not do I do plenty of research. 
Instead I'm just going to talk about what I feel will make you.. think deeper into yourself. Whatever gives you a piece of my mind, at the very least.

#### Memory
What is memory anyways? Well that's easy, it's uh.. crap.. uh.. what is it again..?And that's exactly what it is, except, not exactly. 
That's when you forgot something, it's when your memory is.. unclear or you don't really.. remember.. you can't **recall** it I suppose. 
Which you may wonder, is it a good thing to forget things? Depends. 
When you have a test tomorrow obviously you make it so you focus towards the test in order to remember more and reduce chances of your forgetting a topic. 
(Focus too much and you'll get exhausted) What are situations where you do have to.. forget something? Often times, bad moments. 

#### Moments
Moments where you had that one time everyone laughed at you. Moments where you just experienced pain the most. 
Moments when you experienced puberty and possibly depression. Moments when you lost your phone, or maybe your favorite pen, or maybe your laptop. Bad moments. 
But oddly enough, your brain remember bad moments more than good moments. Do you remember what cake you had when you were turning 6? 
Do you remember one person who has ever complimented you, and what way? Do you remember the person who lets you copy their homework? 
Do you remember the last time you smiled? No? Well that's odd isn't it.. something you don't want to remember, you remember it pretty well. But nice everyday actions are often forgotten. 
Bad memories, even if you try to forget it, it just hangs around there until something reminds you of that particular event. Speaking of, this reminds me of a thing called nostalgia.

### Nostalgia
A feeling that just brings back memories, a feeling that just reminds you how much the world has changed over the past few years. 
A feeling that is very subtle but present. Nostalgia. Maybe it's an old song you've played over and over back in the day when you were young. 
Maybe it was an old drawing of yours that just.. looked terrible, but it brings back memories. 
Maybe toys you've played with before, things like that just brings you back don't they... it feels nice when you are reminded the time before you experienced puberty.. not necessarily of course. 
Let's dive deeper into our minds. Something that can help you or just recalls memory. Maybe something like dreams. 

### Dreams
What are dreams? I personally think it's your brain trying to experiment with situations in either life or just objects or even, memory recalling. 
Depends, of course. The easiest way to dream about something is if something you cling on or something that's always there in your sight, disappears for a period of time. 
Dreams help you remember what it looked like before you completely forget about it. It's like a last goodbye. Maybe moving to a new home or a new room that looks completely different.
Another type of dream is when your mind is experimenting. It can be pain, it can be.. uhhhh.... sexual desire (if you're lucky). Anything, really.

#### A dark friend
Alright but what about nightmares? They're actually an indication that your body isn't in a healthy condition. 
You're probably sick, wrong sleeping position, slept too late, sleep paralysis, playing too many horror games.. those kind of things. 
You should be worried if you're healthy and not the type who wants to see what sleep paralysis looks like (don't). The next time you're sick, just hope that you won't get any nightmares.

(Before going to the next topic I just want to say that I'm sorry for what I'm going to say next.. except not really)

### Your subconcious 
The next topic is a little bit more towards how you remember things. As I said before, you tend to remember bad memories more than good ones most of the time. 
My guess is that this is your brain learning from your previous mistakes. You don't want to repeat the same embarrassment twice in front of class, it's good that you remember not to do it next time. 
To learn. Someone once said "You learn something, when it's already too late". I can't agree more. You fail at something, you learn not to fail next time. 
That's just how it works. You do these things subconsciously. 

#### Manual Mode
You know what else you do subconsciously? Blinking. Breathing. Those stuff. Of course now you're reminded and will continue to do it manually, but eventually you'll forget and have it back on automatic. 
What else do you do subconsciously? Reading? Playing rhythm games? What about sleep? Do you ever have that moment when you want to know when's the moment you fall asleep, but end up not sleeping at all? 
Yeah that sucks. So, what else is there left to say about memory? Maybe when you're at school and you have to study about a stupid subject no one likes? 
How do our brains function and what's the most efficient way to study something?

### No one likes school
Well I can't answer all of those questions but let's try. How does studying work? Again, not an expert. 
To me, your brain just perceives information and tries to store it somewhere based on priority. Sadly this "priority" can't be adjusted, but maybe you can do something else. 
Maybe you can make it so certain things you see triggers a memory recall. Maybe it's just if you doodle around shapes and spirals. The next time you have a test you have that "checkpoint" you can go back and replay. 
This.. doesn't always work, and you just end up failing the test to a subject you hate the most. What's the most efficient way to study? That is a difficult question as it varies through different people. 
Just.. highlight or something I don't know. Some say use flashcards, some say try to test yourself and see if you can pass (Without opening the book).

### What are you?
Well, that just about wraps up for this topic, I don't really have much to say other than this: you're not in control. You are not you. 
You subconsciously do things, you can end up doing something, but end up forgetting why you stood up and walked to the kitchen. 
You forgot what to grab. Memory becomes disrupted. Blurry. Fuzzy. What is that thing you're trying to get from the kitchen.. What is it.. and at last, you remembered. 
You just wanted to look at your new kitchen. That's all. You didn't really want to grab anything, no actually you just remembered you wanted to grab a plate. 
That new kitchen though.. you feel like the memories of the old kitchen disappearing. Reappearing in your mind only once in your dreams before vanishing into nothing but thin air. 
Though dreams can't really be thin air, they're just.. visualizations or.. illusions in your mind. It's all in your head, buddy.

And as always, I hope this (somewhat) inspired you, in the near future.
