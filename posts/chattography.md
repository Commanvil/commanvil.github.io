Chattography - Casual 101
=========================

Hey! When you're chatting with someone... do you ever want to know how to show **expressions** and **personality** while chatting to someone? Do you ever wonder what those expressions even mean? No? Well who cares, because I'm going to tell you anyway!

Chattography. You'd think it's a word I just made up, well you're right, it is. I simply combined the word chat and graphic.  
Why? Because I wanted an easier way to describe how people chatting in social media can have personality and express themselves. The point of all this is to tell you what "tones" you are actually giving when chatting towards other people. 

## Formality 
Let's start with being formal. Use this when you're chatting to those superior to you, or maybe at a time where casual chatting just won't fit. Following standard rules (like remembering to use uppercase and a period). Nothing out of the ordinary here. But you can always add some details here and there. <- much like that sentence where I added variety, using words like "always" or "here and there". Variation is always nice to have in your "style". 

## Casual 
what about casual? well in this form u just use lowercase and abbv. on just about anything (I still recommend you to use uppercase on 'i'). Also, when chatting casually, try to avoid writing in sentences.. but if you do, that's absolutely fine as well. Now, there are some other things to keep in mind. 

#### Exclamation marks 

When chatting casually, you should keep in mind where and when you use exclamation marks! It may sound very cringy and many people may not like it! 

##### To not place when sound odd 
Never place them after those expressive internet abbreviations (such as: lol!! omg!! wtf!!) In this case, if you want to add emphasis, you can only fully capitalize OMG. Fully capitalizing LOL or WTF makes you sound like a total idiot and should be avoided; unless you do want to sound cringy. 

##### To place when needed 
Never place them unnecessarily! It's quite simple, use them when you need to. Just look up on how exclamation marks are used in commanding or even sarcasm. An example of sarcasm would be: "Wow you did it! You failed! Congratu-freaking-lations!" 

Another thing to note is that exclamation marks should be placed in phrases and not just in a single word. 
"shut up!!" is fine-ish, while "shut!!" is not. 

#### Question marks 
Much simpler to use compared to exclamation marks. It's mostly not cringy so feel free to use them. I will say a couple of things however: Saying "?" alone sounds like a "eh?" tone, while saying "?????" is like saying "huhhhh?". Most casual chatters that use question words like "what/wot/why/when/where" are too lazy to use question marks or just don't feel like it. 

#### Capitalization 
As said before, some words may sound odd when capitalized. Especially when you say "Wtf/Omg/Lol" like that. It's very disturbing because it's like you're mixing something formal and something casual together into a huge bowl of mess. Note that these are only example abbv/words, and there could be many others as well. 

#### Quotation marks 
"Pretty simple, casual chatters use it for sarcasm. Other times for innuendos.. or just use it as it should be used." at least that's what they want you to think. Sure 

#### Dots and periods 
Ah... did you feel that? That's the feeling of.. uh.. using lots of dots in your sentences. What do those mean anyway? Well.. they give the tone of "extension". Meaning it's pronounced in a longer duration. "Um" is very quickly said, while "Um......" is similar to "Ummmm". Another use is to add the tone of "uncertainty". For example. "I'm not so sure about that...." or "idk... maybe". (The more dots you put, the more the "uncertainty" tone increases) 
Note: other times this can indicate sarcasm, such as "Sure...... I believe you......" 

#### Dashes/Hyphens 
Wait did you just- Uh.. well anyway, I'm pretty sure you know what it's used for. It's when texts are cut out suddenl- or maybe some-word-you-made-up connecting it into one. Many uses. 

#### The squiggle 
Oh boy, we couldn't forget this important fella. Commonly used by weird people. You know like.. kyu~! or nyaaah~
It's basically a dash/hyphen, except this one's like the cuter version. Keep in mind that dashes can't be written like "kyu-!" as the ~ is like an "extender". Similar to the dots... except that dots give a normal/uncertain tone, while squiggles give a happy tone! How sweet.. 

## Conclusion
Eh..? Is that all I have to say? Was there even a point in all of this nonsense? Yes there is (somewhere). The point of all this is to help you send messages in a style that everyone likes. The reason why this whole thing was written mostly formal is because this isn't a chat app. This is text written onto this very website. There shouldn't be any casual abbv. nor should there be any odd lowercase sentences (except there was one point where I did, intentionally) Which is why you should always change your style depending on the context. 
It is rather difficult to explain all sorts of details in how people chat and what tone it gives because it's not that straightforward. Today you just learned the tip of the iceberg of Dos and Don'ts on how to chat. I didn't really have to teach you how but I kinda did. 
I hope this (somewhat) helps you in the future. 

(Tip: messages in brackets sound like when you're mumbling)
