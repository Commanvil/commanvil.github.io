Something we all wonder at some point.. **What is the meaning of life?**
Do we have a reason to live? Wouldn't it better to just kill ourselves and just remove all the suffering that we anticipate every single day? Those are great questions, but let's think a little deeper. 
Something like, what is a question? A form of language to request information? Is that what that is?  

### Why do we ask questions?

You might think that I'm getting a little off topic, but here's the thing. 
In the oldest of times where language didn't have a way to ask questions, no one really wondered what life meant because there's no way to ask yourself. 
So do other animals ask themselves the meaning of life? If they do, how? Did they make their own language that consists of "asking a question" or something? 
Or maybe they don't and that's why animals don't get in news reports for commiting suicide.. unless maybe they do, I'm not so sure myself

### Meaning of Life..?

Now let's get back to the main topic. Life and questions. What's the meaning of life? If you ask me, it's to watch anime and just have something to entertain you. 
Whether it's comedy or arcade or whatever. If you look deeper into that answer, what I'm actually saying is that the meaning of life is to.. forget about life itself. 
The concept known as life should just be forgotten and I gurantee you'll enjoy it more than you think. Why? Well there you go again asking me questions, but I'll tell you why.
<br><br>
If you simply just **forget the concept of life,** and just be how who you used to be when you didn't think too deep into it, 
you'll be happier because you're technically erasing the "pain" from your memory and just move on. Let destiny carry you, going with the flow... they said. 
That's the meaning of life, in my opinion.
<br><br>
So, let me ask you right now. How are you? Good? Maybe feeling that moment where you revisit a topic you don't really want to talk about because "reasons"? 
I must admit it is a deep topic and it really settled your mind a little into a nice and calm flow of text drifting through, just going in and flowing out of your mind.. 
Let all of it sink in, take a deep breath and we'll continue to a deeper topic.

## Death

Death. The end of life, or the absence of life. 
Where everything you ever felt or saw, everything you've experienced, every game you play, every anime you've watched, all the things you love, food you ate.. are all gone. That's it. 
You're dead. You lost, it's game over. No respawning. Is this truely the end of "you" as a human being? Where do you go after that? What does it feel like to even experience death? 
Great questions and the answer is simply emptiness. It's not just dark, it's not just space, it's empty. Empty space. (Of course this depends on religion and what not but let's cast that aside momentarily) 
Nothing but emptiness. All the friends you made? They probably **forgot** about you. Your loved ones? They're probably trying to forget as well. 
They do remember you, but at the same time they **don't want to remember you...** It's not your fault, it's just that they want to live a **happy** life. 
That is the cycle of Life and Death. You live, there's stuff, you die, stuff disappears, you disappear. You're gone. Erased. Wiped out. Non-existent. 
You can't breathe even if you try, you can't see yourself, you can't go insane even if you wanted to, you're suffocating in nothing. It's okay, you won't have any memory that you're dead. 
<br><br>
**Cause you don't want yourself to feel your body slowly decomposing into tiny little bits having all your organs inside you chewed up and destroyed, all your blood getting sucked into the void 
until you're nothing but a dead skeleton.**
<br><br>
Isn't that how life works? By forgetting the concept itself and enjoy it while it lasts, and when it does end, it ends forever. 
Why do people believe in God? Maybe they just want to have a way to think all is well and good, and there's nothing you should worry about. 
You're absolutely fine, right? You have God to just protect you and probably bring you to heaven and.. how do you even know if that's true of not? You know what I say? **Only God knows if God exists or not. **
Until then, you're stuck on this ***planet*** still trying to continue life and try to keep ***existing***.. why? Maybe it's just.. instinct.. that tell you to continue life. 
When was the last time you used your *instincts*? Who knows? what matters is.. you'll **die**, we all will die too sooner or later. The difference is just ***when***.
<br><br>
Well, let me ask you the same question as last time. How are you? Feeling a little *tingly* now? Just a bit? Maybe? 
Don't you worry, in life there is nothing you should be **afraid** of, in fact you should expect everything bad will happen sooner or later. "The worse is yet to come". 
That phrase has made **a lot more sense** to me than it did before. 
<br><br>
After reading this, refresh yourself with a nice cup of tea.. maybe watch some videos and maybe play your favourite games. Because you don't have much time, don't you now? 
The next time someone says **"Happy Birthday"** to you, don't forget, it just means you're one year closer to death. And as always, **I hope this is (somewhat) useful in the future.**
